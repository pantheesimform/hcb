** What is HTML **
html(hyper text markup language) is used to create and structure web pages.
It defines the structure and content of web documents using tags and attributes to build and format interactive elements.

** Structure of HTML Page **
<!DOCTYPE html> --> our document acts appropriately
<html lang="en"> --> root ele, lan is for doc's default language
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> --> ensuring that the page renders at the viewport width
    <title>Document</title> --> title of page, shown in the browser tab where the page is loaded, bookmark, favourite a page, it can also describe the page.
</head>
<body> --> include all materials wish to display to website visitors when they visit your page.
    content here
</body>
</html>

** Elements and Attributes **

** Styling and Formatting **

** Block and Inline Elements **

** HTML Semantics **

** Images and Favicon (favourite icon) **
favicon --> file format - ICO(icon), PNG

** Tables and Lists **
<th> used to give header in the cell of a table, col header whereas <thead> used to give the header of a group of a table, table header. scope attr definies th is row/col scoped.
<thead> grp of header rows. So you have more possibilities for scripting and formatting. authors give browsers the ability to include the header rows on each page of a printed, multi-page table, as well as the ability to present a long table with a scrolling body and static header rows
<col>, <colgroup> useful for applying styles to entire columns, instead of repeating the styles for each cell, for each row.
<colgroup> tag specifies a group of one or more columns in a table for formatting.

** HTML Layout Elements **
special semantic elements that are used to define the structure and layout of a web page. 
useful to arrange (divide) the content into logical sections that improve the readability and accessibility of the webpage for readers.
<header> - Defines a header for a document or a section, top of webpage
<nav> - Defines a set of navigation links
<section> - Defines a section in a document, can be multiple sections in a single page
<article> - Defines an independent, self-contained content such as a forum post, magazine, blog post.
<aside> - Defines content aside from the content (like a sidebar), related or unrelated, usually for ads.
<footer> - Defines a footer for a document or a section
<details> - Defines additional details that the user can open and close on demand
<summary> - Defines a heading for the <details> element

** Responsiveness **
<meta name="viewport" content= "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
It sets the width of web pages to match the device’s screen width, ensuring content adapts to different screen sizes.
Adaptive web design uses multiple fixed layouts for different screen sizes, while responsive web design uses a single flexible layout that adjusts dynamically to the screen size.

** Entities and Symbols **
Reserved characters in HTML must be replaced with entities, &lt; --> &#60; || &gt; 
&nbsp; --> non breaking space(handy when breaking the words might be disruptive, space that will not break into a new line, prevent browsers from truncating spaces in HTML pages)
&entity_name; &#entity_number;

** HTML Forms **
<label> element is useful for screen-reader users, who have difficulty clicking on very small regions
autocomplete - automatically complete values based on values that the user has entered before.
enctype - Specifies how the form-data should be encoded when submitting it to the server (only for method="post")
attributes -> accept-charset, action, autocomplete, enctype, method, name, novalidate, rel, target
elements -> <input>, <label>, <select>, <textarea>, <button>, <fieldset>, <legend>, <datalist>, <output>, <option>, <optgroup>
datalist's id and input's list attribute must be same. its like search box with suggestions.

** HTML Graphics **
SVG(Scalable Vector Graphics) are images created by a markup language that are reusable, simple, high-quality standalone images that can be exported and imported as well.
inside svg tags we can use other shapes tags like circle, rect, ellipse

** HTML Media **
The media attribute specifies what media/device the linked document is optimized for.
This attribute is used to specify that the target URL is designed for special devices (like iPhone) , speech or print media
This attribute can accept several values.

** Cross Browser HTML **
we should always check cross browser compatibility of our website for better reach, UX and SEO. 
also there might be possible that some of tags are depricated in some version of browsers, so we can verify and change it.

Semantic Elements: convey the meaning of the content, improving the document's clarity and structure.
Layout Elements: control the layout or apply styles without conveying specific content meaning.

Non-Semantic Tags <div>, <span>, <b>, <i>, <u>, <abbr>, <acronym>, <big>, <center>, <font>, <s>, <small>, <strike>, <sub>, <sup>, <tt>
**

<cite>- mark up the title of a cited creative work(a book, poem, movie, website,... name to show in italic)
<data>- links a given piece of content with a machine-readable translation. (if want to show str to use and id/code to server/machine)
<embed>- embeds external content at the specified point in the document
<figure>- self-contained content, potentially with an optional caption
<frame>- area in which another HTML document can be displayed. used within a <frameset>. 
            not encouraged because of certain disadvantages such as performance problems and lack of accessibility for users with screen readers.
            Instead use <iframe> may be preferred.
<hgroup>- heading and related content. It groups a single <h1>–<h6> element with one or more <p>
<iframe>- nested browsing context, embedding another HTML page into the current one.
<ins>- used with del(cacelled txt) to show newly added txt(underlined txt)
<link>- relationships between the current document and an external resource
<marquee>(dep)- scrolling text
<menu>- semantic alternative for <ul>
<nobr>(dep)- to have all para in one line 
<noembed> or <noframes>(both dep)- to show content when browser does not support res tags.
<noscript>- section of HTML to be inserted if a script type on the page is unsupported or if scripting is currently turned off in the browser.
<object>- external resource, which can be treated as an image, a nested browsing context, or a resource to be handled by a plugin. <param>(dep)
<picture>- 0/0+ <source> elements and one <img> element to offer alternative versions of an image for different display/device scenarios. grouping
<plaintext> is dep of <pre>- preformatted text which is to be presented exactly as written in the HTML file
<portal>- Enables seamless navigation between pages with a more integrated user experience.
<q>- enclosed text is a short inline quotation. Most modern browsers implement this by surrounding the text in quotation marks.
        This element is intended for short quotations that don't require paragraph breaks; for long <blockquote>
<rp>- Provides fallback content for browsers that don't support ruby annotations.
<rt>- Specifies the pronunciation or explanation of characters in a <ruby> element.
<ruby>- Displays small annotations above or below text, often used for East Asian typography.
<samp>- sample/quoted output from a computer program. Its contents are typically rendered using the browser's default monospaced font (Courier/Lucida Console).
<search>-Represents a search form; currently an experimental feature.
<slot>
<template>- mechanism for holding HTML fragments, which can either be used later via JavaScript or generated immediately into shadow DOM
<track>- child of the media elements, <audio> and <video>. Each track element lets you specify a timed text track (or time-based data) that can be displayed in parallel with the media element, for example to overlay subtitles or closed captions on top of a video or alongside audio tracks.
            Provides text tracks for <video> and <audio> elements, such as subtitles or captions.
<wbr>- Suggests a possible line-break opportunity within text.
data-* attri - Custom data attributes used to store extra information on HTML elements, accessible via JavaScript.
