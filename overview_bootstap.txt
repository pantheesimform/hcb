bootstrap - frontend toolkit

Popper - don’t plan to use dropdowns, popovers, or tooltips, save some kilobytes by not including it.
bs changes border-box from content-box for not effecting content bcz of padding
If we require Internet Explorer support, please use Bootstrap v4
bs js is not supported in other js frameworks like react(react-bs) vue(bsvue) angular(ng-bs) so use framework specific version

** breakpoints 
Extra small(nothing to mention) <576px, sm ≥576px, md ≥768px, lg ≥992px, xl ≥1200px, xxl ≥1400px

** .container sets max-width at each breakpoint while .container-fluid does not

** grid 
Use responsive .row-cols-* to quickly set the number of columns that best render your content and layout. 
    Whereas normal .col-* apply to the individual columns (e.g., .col-md-4), the row columns are set on the parent .row as a shortcut. 
    With .row-cols-auto you can give the columns their natural width.
Gutter are horizontal padding of 1.5rem(24px) :- g/gx/gy-md/sm/xxl/xs/xl/none-number
