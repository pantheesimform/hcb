bootstrap - frontend toolkit

Popper - don’t plan to use dropdowns, popovers, or tooltips, save some kilobytes by not including it.
bs changes border-box from content-box for not effecting content bcz of padding
If we require Internet Explorer support, please use Bootstrap v4
bs js is not supported in other js frameworks like react(react-bs) vue(bsvue) angular(ng-bs) so use framework specific version
bootstrap.min.css has been minified. This means all the whitespace and other extra characters have been removed. This is commonly done for use in production, to reduce the size of the file. When developing, it is usually helpful to use the unminified version, since, as you said, it is readable.

** breakpoints 
Extra small(nothing to mention) <576px, sm ≥576px, md ≥768px, lg ≥992px, xl ≥1200px, xxl ≥1400px

** .container sets max-width at each breakpoint while .container-fluid does not

** grid 
Use responsive .row-cols-* to quickly set the number of columns that best render your content and layout. 
    Whereas normal .col-* apply to the individual columns (e.g., .col-md-4), the row columns are set on the parent .row as a shortcut. 
    With .row-cols-auto you can give the columns their natural width.
Gutter are horizontal padding of 1.5rem(24px) :- g/gx/gy-md/sm/xxl/xs/xl/none-number

** zIndex - z-n1, z-0/1/2/3
