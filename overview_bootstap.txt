bootstrap - frontend toolkit

Popper - donâ€™t plan to use dropdowns, popovers, or tooltips, save some kilobytes by not including it.
bs changes border-box from content-box for not effecting content bcz of padding
If we require Internet Explorer support, please use Bootstrap v4
bs js is not supported in other js frameworks like react(react-bs) vue(bsvue) angular(ng-bs) so use framework specific version
