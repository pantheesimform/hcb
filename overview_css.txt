CSS (cascading style sheets) is stylesheet language

** CSS selectors **
basic selectors - id, class, ele type
IDs are unique per document only to select one specific element. Multiple ids results in invalid code, and will cause strange behavior in many places.
multiple classes per element, to layer on styles as required.
tell browser which HTML elements should be selected for CSS property values inside the rule applied to them, element(s) selected by the selector are subject of the selector.
if selector is syntactically invalid, the whole rule will be ignored.
article :first-child 1st child of article whereas article:first-child select any <article> element that is the 1st child of another element.
    To avoid this confusion, we can add the universal selector like article *:first-child
** selector type
1. type/tag/element selector
2. class selector (case-sensitive) (@)
3. id selector (#)
4. universal selector (*)
class for specific tag --> span.highlight different from h1.highlight
2+ class in tag --> .class1.class2 -- will apply to only those elements who have both(any tag)
id for specific tag --> span#highlight
more selector for common styling code --> h1, .class1, .class2, #id1,...
to apply globally--> p * selects all the nested elements inside the <p> element, * to apply whole doc/page same style
** attr selectors
1. attribute presence and value selector -- selector_attr.jpeg
2. substr matching selector -- selector_substr.jpeg
** selector structure
1. simple selector --> #id1
2. compound selector --> tag1#id1 (type and universal selecor must come first)
3. complex selector --> tag1#id1>.class1
4. selector list --> , sep list of selectors
5. relative selector --> accepted within certain contexts, such as the :has() pseudo-class. (can't be used in selector list)

** nesting in css **
1. tag1{& tag2{}} is tag1 tag2{} (& nesting selector is not required, but adding it helps to explicitly show that CSS nesting is being used.)
1. tag1{~ tag2{}} is tag1 ~tag2{}

** combinators **
1. decendant comb -- .box p --> selects p tag with parent tag having class box
2. child comb -- tag1>tag2 --> direct child (h1 inside div)
3. next sibling comb -- tag1 + tag2 (p just next to/adjacent h1 not other p)
4. Subsequent-sibling combinator -- tag1 ~ tag2 (all p that are coming after h1)

** CSS box-Model
content, padding, border, margin ; outline

** CSS value and units **
absolute units - cm,mm,q,in,pc,pt,px
relative units :
em - relative to font size of current/parent ele, if given 'x em' means x times than parent ele
rem - relative to font size of root ele, 'x rem' means x times than root ele, by default it is 16px
vh and vw - viewports height and width
lh and rlh - 1st is relative to self line height while other is relative to root ele
Percentage 
number (opacity)
**color - name, hexadecimal(0-9, a-f, #xxxxxx), rgb(255,255,255/0.x) 0.x is alpha/opacity
HWB(hue, whiteness, blackness), HSL(hue, saturation, lightness)
**specifying generated content. the value is quoted to demonstrate that it is a string. "content property". can add url, emoji,...
quotes property defines how to apply or override them
** math functions like calc(); min(), max(), clamp(); sin(), cos(), tan() -- rotating angle

** sizing in CSS
Percentage, min max, viewports

** styling background and border **
background-color
background-image -- background-repeat(repeat, no-repeat, repeat-x/y, space, round), background-size(cover, contain), background-position
background-attachment (scroll, fixed, local) (how bg is scrolled when content is being scrolled)
border: size style color, border-radius(rounded)

** Text formatting and fonts ** diff bet font and text - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21075127/font-vs-text-in-css-property-names, https://codesweetly.com/text-vs-font/
*font style*
font stack(multiple font families)
font-style(normal, italic, oblique)
font-weight(light,normal,bold,extrabold,black,100-900,lighter/bolder - Sets current ele boldness to one step lighter/heavier than its parent ele boldness)
text-transform(none,upppercase,lowercase,capitalize,full-width)
text-decoration(none,underline,overline,line-through)(shorthand for text-decoration-line, text-decoration-style, and text-decoration-color)
text-shadows(horizontal offset,vertical offset,blur radius,color)(can have multiple text shadows)
font-variant(shorthand property allows you to set all the font variants for a font)
font-stretch(font-width -- not supported yet)(selects a normal, condensed, or expanded face from a font)
text-rendering?
*text layout style*
text-align(left,right,center,justify)
line-height, word-spacing, letter-spacing
text-indent(how much horizontal space should be left before the beginning of the first line of the text content)
text-overflow(clip,ellipsis)(we have to make that text to be overflowed, for that have to use overflow:hidden, text-wrap:no-wrap)
white-space(whitespace and associated line breaks inside the element are handled)
word-break(whether line breaks appear wherever the text would otherwise overflow its content box)
hyphens(how words should be hyphenated when text wraps across multiple lines)
line-break(Relax or strengthen line breaking for Asian languages)

** CSS Gradients and shadows**
background-image: linear-gradient(to direction/angle,color1,color2,...),repeating-linear-gradient(),
background-image: radial-gradient(shape size at position, color1, ...);
background-image: conic-gradient([from angle] [at position,] color [degree], color [degree], ...); repeating-conic-gradient();
text-shadow: as previously mentioned (https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_shadows.asp)
box-shadow: https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_shadows_box.asp

** styling lists **
list-style-type (number,letter,roman,...)
list-style-position (inside/outside)
list-style-image (url,...)
** styling anchors/links **
:link(blue)
:visited(purple)
:hover(hand icon)
:focus(on press of tab key, shows border)
:active(red, click event)
to style change properties like color, cursor, outline

** fonts insertion in CSS **
1. font-family: Helvetica, "Trebuchet MS", Verdana, sans-serif;
2. @font-face ruleset at the start of the CSS, which specifies the font file(s) to download.
@font-face {
  font-family: "myFont";
  src: url("myFont.woff2") format(woff2), 2nd font;
}

** table styling **
zebra striping -- tr:nth-child(odd/even/1/2/...){}

** CSS Box Sizing **
content-box(default) - width & height properties include the content only, but does not include the padding, border, margin
border-box - width & height properties include the content, padding, and border, but don't include the margin

** global attributes ** 
initial -- sets the value defined by browser
revert -- sets the value defined by browser
inherit -- sets value from its parent
unset -- will unset all styling and select what should be applied initial/inherit by element's actual property

** Outline is a line outside of the element's border. outline takes space from margin.
outline-offset CSS property sets the amount of space between an outline and the edge or border of an element.
** overlay ?

** position in css **
static(default) -- follow the other elements in document flow
relative -- same as static but allows to change top,left,right,bottom
absolute -- completely remove ele from doc flow and acts like it doesnot exists. want to stick on screen. 
    if parent is set to relative than it will be set on parent's top. set on same place.
fixed -- same as absolute but does not see the parent's relative. so will stick on web page's top. moves with the page.
sticky -- relative + fixed (be relative until it goes outside of page)

** z-index doesn't work with staticly defined/non-defined elements, works with relative

** due to flex-box usage of float and clear is very lowercase
float left right, clear right left both

** display
inline -- in one line, prevents width, padding-top, margin-top
inline-block -- to have all that is prevented by inline
block --
none -- to remove element
grid, inline-grid, flex, inline-flex
visibility: hidden -- just removes it visibally

** flex
display: flex
flex-direction: col/row/col-rev/row-rev

** * container properties::::
no justify-items in flexbox, align-items for one row, align-content for more than 1 row when we wrap content
flex-flow is shorthand for flex-direction flex-wrap
gap:row col
* item property 
order: num(1,2,...)
flex-grow: num -- how many items space this item is going to take
flex-shrink: num -- how many items space this item is going to take


** grid
grid-template-columns/rows: [name1]1stsize [name2]2ndsize...
grid-row/column:from/to (num to num)(line1/line2)(name1/name2) orrrr grid-row-start/end:num;
fr is just an unit specifically for columns, represents fraction of available width. repeat(x (times), y fr)

** at rulesets
@identifier (RULE)
@charset "UTF-8" - used character set in doc
@import - to include external stylesheet
@layer - to create layers, in this rules the layer which is written at last is on th ehighest priority. rule for order of styles.
@font-face - font resource locations, both local and external
@keyframes - named animation by describing defining CSS styles
@media - for responsivness
@property - more expressive with the definition of a custom property with the ability to associate a type with the property, set default values, control inheritance.
@scope - @scope (scope root) to (scope limit) { } - when we don't want to use complex combinators

** global styling
tag{ --var_name:value; } tag2{ property:var(var_name) }

** @media
@media screen,print and (orientation:landscape) and  (hover:hover) and  (min/min,width,height : or <= or >=) and (color){}

** specificity - applies css as higher the no.
inline style, ids, class/attr/pseudo class, pseudo ele/type

** pseudo classes
* :is() have higher specificity than :where()
* <div> before <!-- Rest of stuff inside the div --> after  </div>

            animation-delay, animation-iteration-count, animation-direction, 
            animation-fill-mode, (none, forwards, backwards, both)
            animation-play-state, (running, paused)

            transition-delay;

:root, * , html - precedence, to apply same properties to all
